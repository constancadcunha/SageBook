  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section fade-in">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SageBook is more than a recipe app. It’s your personal kitchen guide that combines the warmth of a handwritten cookbook with the clarity and support of an experienced mentor. With SageBook, cooking becomes a mindful, rewarding experience. You gain knowledge while preparing delicious food, and every meal strengthens your skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea came from real people’s frustrations: countless failed recipes, wasted ingredients, and the feeling of being lost when instructions skip essential details. SageBook fills in these gaps with step-by-step guidance, helpful visuals, and a friendly tone that reduces stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire experience is wrapped in a cozy, cottagecore aesthetic: soft colors, gentle illustrations, and textures that feel familiar and comforting. Users don’t just cook — they become part of a story, building confidence with every meal, celebrating small victories, and sharing knowledge with a supportive community.
    </p>

  <!-- The Problem -->
  <section id="problem" class="section fade-in">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p id="typing-quote"></p>
    <p>
      Modern cooking resources often overwhelm beginners and frustrate intermediate cooks. Standard recipes assume you understand culinary terms, timing, and foundational techniques. One misstep can mean ruined food, wasted money, and a sense of failure that discourages trying again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surveys showed that over 60% of new cooks quit halfway through recipes due to unclear instructions or missing context. Online videos can help but lack personalization, leaving viewers to guess adjustments for their own kitchens and tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s missing is a patient, step-by-step mentor — something that guides people in the moment, explains why things matter, and gives supportive nudges instead of overwhelming checklists. That’s where SageBook makes a difference.

  <!-- The Solution with Interactive Tabs -->
  <section id="solution" class="section fade-in">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <div class="solution-tabs">
      <button class="tab-button active" data-tab="step">🧑‍🍳 Step-by-Step</button>
      <button class="tab-button" data-tab="videos">🎥 Skill Videos</button>
      <button class="tab-button" data-tab="badges">🏅 Badges</button>
      <button class="tab-button" data-tab="community">📝 Community Tips</button>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content active" id="tab-step">
      <p>
        SageBook’s step-by-step feature breaks recipes into precise, manageable actions. Each step includes clear instructions, ingredient checks, timing cues, and cautionary notes for common pitfalls. You can swipe forward or backward without losing context, ensuring you never feel rushed or confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach is especially helpful for multi-step or advanced dishes like pastries, sauces, or bread making, where missing one detail can spoil the outcome. It’s like having a calm friend reading the recipe with you, pausing when needed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab-videos">
      <p>
        SageBook includes a rich library of bite-sized skill videos. From mastering knife grips and chopping onions efficiently, to advanced pastry techniques and temperature control, these tutorials build confidence fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each video is paired with visual cues and practical tips. Users can bookmark favorites, practice skills separately, and revisit techniques anytime — no need to scroll through long, irrelevant cooking shows on YouTube.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab-badges">
      <p>
        Motivation is key to developing a habit. SageBook gamifies the learning experience with badges and milestones. Complete your first dish? Earn a “First Feast” badge. Master a tricky technique? Collect a “Skill Star” badge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users also see progress charts that highlight improvement areas and achievements, turning cooking into a rewarding journey. It feels like leveling up a character — except the hero is you.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab-community">
      <p>
        Cooking is communal. SageBook lets users share short tips, alternatives, or notes for each recipe step. Wondering if you can swap ingredients? Chances are someone else has done it and left a note.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shared wisdom transforms recipes into living documents that adapt to real kitchens and cultures, strengthening the sense of community and collective learning.
